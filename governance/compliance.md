# Governance and Compliance Document

## Overview
This document describes the governance, legal, and regulatory compliance considerations for the Terraform AWS Project. It also highlights strategies for maintaining auditable infrastructure configurations.

---

## Compliance Objectives
### Legal Requirements:
- Ensure compliance with **GDPR** for protecting user data stored in AWS regions.
- Adhere to **CLOUD Act** requirements for US-based infrastructure.

### Regulatory Standards:
- Infrastructure is designed to comply with:
  - **ISO/IEC 27001** for Information Security Management.
  - **SOC 2** Type II for Service Organization Controls.
  - **HIPAA** for applications dealing with protected health information (PHI).

---

## Governance Policies
### Tagging Strategy:
All resources are tagged with the following:
- **Environment**: Identifies the environment (e.g., Dev, Prod).
- **Owner**: Specifies responsible team/department.
- **Compliance**: Identifies applicable standards (e.g., ISO27001, SOC2).

### Audit Logs:
- **AWS CloudTrail** is enabled for tracking changes to resources.
- S3 backends for state files have versioning and encryption enabled to ensure traceability and integrity.

### Data Protection:
- Use encrypted state files stored in S3 with SSE-KMS enabled.
- Ensure sensitive data is handled using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.

---

## Auditable Practices
- **Infrastructure State**: Maintain Terraform state files in a version-controlled, encrypted S3 bucket.
- **Access Control**: Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP) by restricting access via IAM roles and policies.
- **Change Tracking**: Use GitHub version control for infrastructure changes, including pull requests and peer reviews.

---

## Monitoring and Alerts
- **AWS CloudWatch** is configured to monitor infrastructure health.
- Alerts are set for resource utilization thresholds and unexpected changes.

---

## Summary
By following these governance and compliance practices, this project ensures secure, auditable, and regulatory-compliant infrastructure deployments.
